# 🌌 Cosmic Soup with JAX

**Exploring the boundary of order and chaos through emergent lifeforms.**

Cosmic Soup is a JAX-powered exploration of emergent life at the boundary of order and chaos, inspired by Cosmic Soup and the Game of Life. Real-time simulations, interactive discovery tools, and a future public gallery of evolving digital organisms.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

**Cosmic Soup** is a modern extension of Conway’s Game of Life, introducing continuous dynamics, conservation laws, and rich emergent behaviors.  
This project implements Cosmic Soup using **JAX** for fast, differentiable simulations, and will grow into a **real-time interactive web experience**.

The goals of this project are:
- Build a flexible, efficient simulation engine using JAX.
- Create real-time visualizations to explore emergent behaviors.
- Develop an interactive website for public discovery and contribution.
- Learn deeply about self-organization, geometry, and emergent phenomena.
